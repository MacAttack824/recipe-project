# Dinner Chooser 9000 #

This project is an attempt to throw together 2 years of recipes into a random generator that will return 2-5 recipes at a time.

The return will output...
--- Recipe Name
--- ID Number in file

Once recipes are chosen, the recipe data can be retrieved to display the following...

--- Ingredients to buy with quantities
--- Basic ingredients normally found in a kitchen
--- Step by Step Instructions
--- Alternatively, it can pull the scanned PDF image that can be printed with all this information on it already
